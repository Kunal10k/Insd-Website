                programs in Interior Design, Fashion Design, and Graphic Design, designed to prepare students for
                professional practice in the creative industry. <br>
                INSD Kolkata follows a studio-based learning approach where practical application, skill development,
                and creative execution form the core of education. The emphasis remains on building professional
                competence, creative confidence, and portfolio readiness through consistent hands-on learning rather
                than theory-heavy instruction. <br>

                long-term career preparation.

                <h2 class="title">Global Academic <br> <span>Collaboration</span></h2>

                <p class="para">International School of Design Kolkata believes that design education should extend
                    beyond borders. Through global academic collaborations, the institute provides students with
                    international exposure to design education, creative practices, and learning environments across
                    leading global institutions. <br> <br>
                    INSD Kolkata has established academic tie-ups with reputed international universities including
                    College de Paris, International Business School of Washington (IBSW), University for the Creative
                    Arts (UCA), École Supérieure de Relooking, and ESG Luxe (France). These collaborations connect
                    students to global academic ecosystems focused on design, fashion, creative studies, and
                    professional education.<br> <br>
                    As part of these global partnerships, students have the opportunity to participate in international
                    academic exposure programs, where selected modules are studied at partner universities abroad. This
                    experience allows students to engage with international faculty, global design perspectives, and
                    diverse academic cultures.<br> <br>
                    Global academic exposure helps students broaden their creative outlook, understand international
                    design standards, and develop confidence to operate in a global creative environment. These
                    collaborations strengthen INSD Kolkata’s commitment to delivering design education that is globally
                    informed, professionally relevant, and future-focused.

                    International School of Design Kolkata believes that contemporary design education benefits from
                    global exposure and international academic perspectives. Through global academic collaborations, the
                    institute connects students to learning environments beyond India, supporting broader understanding
                    of design practices, creative cultures, and professional standards. <br> <br>
                    These collaborations are designed to complement classroom learning by introducing students to global
                    academic frameworks and international approaches to design education.

                    <p class="para">
                        Through these global academic collaborations, students at INSD Kolkata have the opportunity to
                        participate in international academic exposure programmes, including short-term study modules
                        conducted at partner institutions abroad. <br> <br>
                        These experiences allow students to engage with international faculty, understand global design
                        perspectives, and experience academic environments beyond their home country, contributing to
                        creative growth and global awareness.
